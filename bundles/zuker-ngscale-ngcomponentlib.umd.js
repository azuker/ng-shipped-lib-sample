 * AnimationBuilder is an injectable service that is available when the {\@link

 * NoopAnimationsModule} modules are used within an application.
 *
 * The purpose if this service is to produce an animation sequence programmatically within an
 * angular component or directive.
 *
 * Programmatic animations are first built and then a player is created when the build animation is
 * attached to an element.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // remember to include the BrowserAnimationsModule module for this to work...
 * import {AnimationBuilder} from '\@angular/animations';
 *
 * class MyCmp {
 *   constructor(private _builder: AnimationBuilder) {}
 *
 *   makeAnimation(element: any) {
 *     // first build the animation
 *     const myAnimation = this._builder.build([
 *       style({ width: 0 }),
 *       animate(1000, style({ width: '100px' }))
 *     ]);
 *
 *     // then create a player from it
 *     const player = myAnimation.create(element);
 *
 *     player.play();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When an animation is built an instance of {\@link AnimationFactory AnimationFactory} will be
 * returned. Using that an {\@link AnimationPlayer AnimationPlayer} can be created which can then be
 * used to start the animation.

 * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the
 * {\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better
 * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression
 * bound to the trigger changes.
 *
 * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the
 * {\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element
 * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that
 * the
 * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\@triggerName]="expression"`.
 *
 * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against
 * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both
 * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values
 * respectively.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The
 * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} declarations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *       state(...),
 *       state(...),
 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Disable Animations
 * A special animation control binding called `\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will
 * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as
 * any animations on the element itself.
 *
 * When true, the `\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example
 * below shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```ts
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [\@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\@.disabled` prevents it from happening
 * (when true).
 *
 * Note that `\@.disbled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on
 * the same element will also be disabled).
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will
 * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular
 * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular
 * component.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   \@HostBinding('\@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\@link query query} for inner
 * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is
 * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\@link
 * animateChild animateChild}.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

 * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given
 * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected
 * to be used within {\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\@link group group}, or {\@link
 * transition transition}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:
 *
 * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay
 * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`
 * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,
 * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the
 * `duration` value in millisecond form.
 * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\@link style style} or {\@link
 * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected
 * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by
 * {\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // various functions for specifying timing data
 * animate(500, style(...))
 * animate("1s", style(...))
 * animate("100ms 0.5s", style(...))
 * animate("5s ease", style(...))
 * animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)", style(...))
 *
 * // either style() of keyframes() can be used
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * animate(500, keyframes([
 *   style({ background: "blue" })),
 *   style({ background: "red" }))
 * ])
 * ```

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `sequence` Specifies a list of animation steps that are run one by one. (`sequence` is used by
 * default when an array is passed as animation data into {\@link transition transition}.)
 *
 * The `sequence` function can either be used within a {\@link group group} or a {\@link transition
 * transition} and it will only continue to the next instruction once each of the inner animation
 * steps have completed.
 *
 * To perform animation styling in parallel with other animation steps then have a look at the
 * {\@link group group} animation function.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `sequence` animation function can either consist of
 * {\@link style style} or {\@link animate animate} function calls. A call to `style()` will apply the
 * provided styling data immediately while a call to `animate()` will apply its styling data over a
 * given time depending on its timing data.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * sequence([
 *   style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *   animate("1s", { opacity: 1 }))
 * ])
 * ```

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of

 *
 * `style` declares a key/value object containing CSS properties/styles that can then be used for
 * {\@link state animation states}, within an {\@link sequence animation sequence}, or as styling data
 * for both {\@link animate animate} and {\@link keyframes keyframes}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `style` takes in a key/value string map as data and expects one or more CSS property/value pairs
 * to be defined.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // string values are used for css properties
 * style({ background: "red", color: "blue" })
 *
 * // numerical (pixel) values are also supported

 *
 * #### Auto-styles (using `*`)
 *
 * When an asterix (`*`) character is used as a value then it will be detected from the element
 * being animated and applied as animation data when the animation starts.
 *
 * This feature proves useful for a state depending on layout and/or environment factors; in such
 * cases the styles are calculated just before the animation starts.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the steps below will animate from 0 to the
 * // actual height of the element
 * style({ height: 0 }),
 * animate("1s", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```
 *
 * {\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of

 *
 * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is active within a
 * component then its associated styles will persist on the element that the trigger is attached to
 * (even when the animation ends).
 *
 * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {\@link transition transition} DSL
 * function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\@link trigger
 * trigger} function.
 *
 * #### The `void` state
 *
 * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not
 * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the
 * associated element is void).
 *
 * #### The `*` (default) state
 *
 * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being
 * animated is not declared within the trigger.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles
 * within the given trigger.
 *
 * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.
 * - `styles` refers to the {\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once
 * the state has been reached.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // "void" is a reserved name for a state and is used to represent
 * // the state in which an element is detached from from the application.
 * state("void", style({ height: 0 }))
 *
 * // user-defined states
 * state("closed", style({ height: 0 }))
 * state("open, visible", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```

/**

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `transition` declares the {\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the
 * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>
 * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting
 * and/or ending state).
 *
 * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this
 * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the
 * function is true then the associated animation will be run.
 *
 * Animation transitions are placed within an {\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition
 * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\@link state animation
 * states} is expected to be defined.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on
 * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition
 * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be
 * triggered.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the
 *   // animation has fully completed itself
 *   state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *   state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *
 *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value
 *   // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 *   transition("on => off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions
 *   transition("on <=> off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas
 *   transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into
 *   // the page and the destination state is unknown
 *   transition("void => *", [
 *     style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *     animate(500)
 *   ]),
 *
 *   // this will capture a state change between any states
 *   transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s")),
 *
 *   // you can also go full out and include a function
 *   transition((fromState, toState) => {
 *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked
 *     return fromState == "off" && toState == "on";
 *   }, animate("1s 0s"))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * #### The final `animate` call
 *
 * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a
 * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc
 * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of
 * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the
 * applied state to be presented correctly.
 *
 * ```
 * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state
 * // is currently active for "myAnimationTrigger"
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :enter and :leave
 *
 * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`
 * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*
 * => void` state changes.
 *
 * ```
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 * ]),
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Boolean values
 * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition
 * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.
 *
 * ```
 * // in the template
 * <div [\@openClose]="open ? true : false">...</div>
 *
 * // in the component metadata
 * trigger('openClose', [
 *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),
 *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),
 *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :increment and :decrement
 * In addition to the :enter and :leave transition aliases, the :increment and :decrement aliases
 * can be used to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.
 *
 * ```
 * import {group, animate, query, transition, style, trigger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * import {Component} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'banner-carousel-component',
 *   styles: [`

 *
 * Note: it's better to use {\@link Router#navigate} service to trigger route changes. Use

 *
 * `Location` is responsible for normalizing the URL against the application's base href.
 * A normalized URL is absolute from the URL host, includes the application's base href, and has no
 * trailing slash:
 * - `/my/app/user/123` is normalized
 * - `my/app/user/123` **is not** normalized
 * - `/my/app/user/123/` **is not** normalized

 * \@whatItDoes Use URL for storing application location data.
 * \@description
 * `PathLocationStrategy` is a {\@link LocationStrategy} used to configure the
 * {\@link Location} service to represent its state in the
 * [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator#Syntax) of the
 * browser's URL.
 *
 * If you're using `PathLocationStrategy`, you must provide a {\@link APP_BASE_HREF}
 * or add a base element to the document. This URL prefix that will be preserved
 * when generating and recognizing URLs.
 *
 * For instance, if you provide an `APP_BASE_HREF` of `'/my/app'` and call
 * `location.go('/foo')`, the browser's URL will become
 * `example.com/my/app/foo`.
 *
 * Similarly, if you add `<base href='/my/app'/>` to the document and call
 * `location.go('/foo')`, the browser's URL will become
 * `example.com/my/app/foo`.

 * The date-time pattern shows how to combine separate patterns for date (represented by {1})

 * What you want to pay attention to are:
 * - possibly removing a space for languages that don't use it, such as many East Asian languages
 * - possibly adding a comma, other punctuation, or a combining word
 *
 * For example:
 * - English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` or `{1}, {0}` (depending on date style), while Japanese uses
 *  `{1}{0}`.
 * - An English formatted date-time using the combining pattern `{1}, {0}` could be
 *  `Dec 10, 2010, 3:59:49 PM`. Notice the comma and space between the date portion and the time
 *  portion.
 *
 * There are four formats (`full`, `long`, `medium`, `short`); the determination of which to use
 * is normally based on the date style. For example, if the date has a full month and weekday
 * name, the full combining pattern will be used to combine that with a time. If the date has
 * numeric month, the short version of the combining pattern will be used to combine that with a
 * time. English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` for full and long styles, and `{1}, {0}` for medium and short
 * styles.

 * when used to format the number 12345.678 could result in "12'345,67". That would happen if the
 * grouping separator for your language is an apostrophe, and the decimal separator is a comma.
 *
 * <b>Important:</b> The characters `.` `,` `0` `#` (and others below) are special placeholders;
 * they stand for the decimal separator, and so on, and are NOT real characters.
 * You must NOT "translate" the placeholders; for example, don't change `.` to `,` even though in
 * your language the decimal point is written with a comma. The symbols should be replaced by the
 * local equivalents, using the Number Symbols for your language.
 *
 * Here are the special characters used in number patterns:
 *
 * | Symbol | Meaning |
 * |--------|---------|
 * | . | Replaced automatically by the character used for the decimal point. |
 * | , | Replaced by the "grouping" (thousands) separator. |
 * | 0 | Replaced by a digit (or zero if there aren't enough digits). |
 * | # | Replaced by a digit (or nothing if there aren't enough). |
 * | ¤ | This will be replaced by a currency symbol, such as $ or USD. |
 * | % | This marks a percent format. The % symbol may change position, but must be retained. |
 * | E | This marks a scientific format. The E symbol may change position, but must be retained. |
 * | ' | Special characters used as literal characters are quoted with ASCII single quotes. |

/**
 * Instantiates a single {\@link Component} type and inserts its Host View into current View.
 * `NgComponentOutlet` provides a declarative approach for dynamic component creation.
 *
 * `NgComponentOutlet` requires a component type, if a falsy value is set the view will clear and
 * any existing component will get destroyed.
 *
 * ### Fine tune control
 *
 * You can control the component creation process by using the following optional attributes:
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletInjector`: Optional custom {\@link Injector} that will be used as parent for
 * the Component. Defaults to the injector of the current view container.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletContent`: Optional list of projectable nodes to insert into the content
 * section of the component, if exists.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory`: Optional module factory to allow dynamically loading other
 * module, then load a component from that module.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression"></ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized injector/content
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   injector: injectorExpression;
 *                                   content: contentNodesExpression;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized ngModuleFactory
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   ngModuleFactory: moduleFactory;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```

/**
 * The `NgForOf` directive instantiates a template once per item from an iterable. The context
 * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable
 * set to the current item from the iterable.
 *
 * ### Local Variables
 *
 * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:
 *
 * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).
 * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is
 * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |
 * async`).
 * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.
 * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.
 * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.
 * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.
 * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.
 *
 * ```
 * <li *ngFor="let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst">
 *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf="isFirst">default</span>
 * </li>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Change Propagation
 *
 * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce
 * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful
 * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can
 * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state
 * such as user input.
 *
 * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.
 * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that
 * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with
 * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old
 * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should
 * be avoided if possible.
 *
 * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.
 * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.
 * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * - `<li *ngFor="let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn">...</li>`
 *
 * With `<ng-template>` element:
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items" let-i="index" [ngForTrackBy]="trackByFn">
 *   <li>...</li>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed
 * example.

/**
 * Conditionally includes a template based on the value of an `expression`.
 *
 * `ngIf` evaluates the `expression` and then renders the `then` or `else` template in its place
 * when expression is truthy or falsy respectively. Typically the:
 *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.
 *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.
 *
 * ## Most common usage
 *
 * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as
 * seen in this example:
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}
 *
 * ## Showing an alternative template using `else`
 *
 * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template
 * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.
 * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after
 * `ngIf` for readability.
 *
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}
 *
 * ## Using non-inlined `then` template
 *
 * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using
 * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can
 * change at runtime as shown in this example.
 *
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}
 *
 * ## Storing conditional result in a variable
 *
 * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the
 * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against
 * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as
 * when using the `async` pipe as shown in following example:
 *
 * ```
 * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!
 * ```
 *
 * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:
 *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the
 *    example above.
 *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.
 *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.
 *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.
 *
 * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local
 * variable as shown in the the example below:
 *
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}
 *
 * Notice that:
 *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.
 *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.
 *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.
 *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only
 *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.
 *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple form:
 * - `<div *ngIf="condition">...</div>`
 * - `<ng-template [ngIf]="condition"><div>...</div></ng-template>`
 *
 * Form with an else block:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; else elseBlock">...</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with a `then` and `else` block:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
 * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with storing the value locally:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition as value; else elseBlock">{{value}}</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```

/**
 * \@ngModule CommonModule
 * \@whatItDoes Formats a date according to locale rules.
 * \@howToUse `date_expression | date[:format[:timezone[:locale]]]`
 * \@description
 *
 * Where:
 * - `expression` is a date object or a number (milliseconds since UTC epoch) or an ISO string
 * (https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).
 * - `format` indicates which date/time components to include. The format can be predefined as
 *   shown below (all examples are given for `en-US`) or custom as shown in the table.
 *   - `'short'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy, h:mm a'` (e.g. `6/15/15, 9:03 AM`)
 *   - `'medium'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y, h:mm:ss a'` (e.g. `Jun 15, 2015, 9:03:01 AM`)
 *   - `'long'`: equivalent to `'MMMM d, y, h:mm:ss a z'` (e.g. `June 15, 2015 at 9:03:01 AM GMT+1`)
 *   - `'full'`: equivalent to `'EEEE, MMMM d, y, h:mm:ss a zzzz'` (e.g. `Monday, June 15, 2015 at
 * 9:03:01 AM GMT+01:00`)
 *   - `'shortDate'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy'` (e.g. `6/15/15`)
 *   - `'mediumDate'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y'` (e.g. `Jun 15, 2015`)
 *   - `'longDate'`: equivalent to `'MMMM d, y'` (e.g. `June 15, 2015`)
 *   - `'fullDate'`: equivalent to `'EEEE, MMMM d, y'` (e.g. `Monday, June 15, 2015`)
 *   - `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm a'` (e.g. `9:03 AM`)
 *   - `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a'` (e.g. `9:03:01 AM`)
 *   - `'longTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a z'` (e.g. `9:03:01 AM GMT+1`)
 *   - `'fullTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a zzzz'` (e.g. `9:03:01 AM GMT+01:00`)
 *  - `timezone` to be used for formatting. It understands UTC/GMT and the continental US time zone
 *  abbreviations, but for general use, use a time zone offset, for example,
 *  `'+0430'` (4 hours, 30 minutes east of the Greenwich meridian)
 *  If not specified, the local system timezone of the end-user's browser will be used.
 *  - `locale` is a `string` defining the locale to use (uses the current {\@link LOCALE_ID} by
 * default)

 * When the expression is a ISO string without time (e.g. 2016-09-19) the time zone offset is not
 * applied and the formatted text will have the same day, month and year of the expression.
 *
 * WARNINGS:
 * - this pipe has only access to en-US locale data by default. If you want to localize the dates
 *   in another language, you will have to import data for other locales.
 *   See the {\@linkDocs guide/i18n#i18n-pipes "I18n guide"} to know how to import additional locale
 *   data.
 * - Fields suffixed with * are only available in the extra dataset.
 *   See the {\@linkDocs guide/i18n#i18n-pipes "I18n guide"} to know how to import extra locale
 *   data.
 * - this pipe is marked as pure hence it will not be re-evaluated when the input is mutated.
 *   Instead users should treat the date as an immutable object and change the reference when the
 *   pipe needs to re-run (this is to avoid reformatting the date on every change detection run
 *   which would be an expensive operation).
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * Assuming `dateObj` is (year: 2015, month: 6, day: 15, hour: 21, minute: 43, second: 11)
 * in the _local_ time and locale is 'en-US':
 *
 * {\@example common/pipes/ts/date_pipe.ts region='DatePipe'}

 * \@description
 * The `async` pipe subscribes to an `Observable` or `Promise` and returns the latest value it has
 * emitted. When a new value is emitted, the `async` pipe marks the component to be checked for
 * changes. When the component gets destroyed, the `async` pipe unsubscribes automatically to avoid
 * potential memory leaks.
 *
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * This example binds a `Promise` to the view. Clicking the `Resolve` button resolves the
 * promise.
 *
 * {\@example common/pipes/ts/async_pipe.ts region='AsyncPipePromise'}
 *
 * It's also possible to use `async` with Observables. The example below binds the `time` Observable
 * to the view. The Observable continuously updates the view with the current time.

 * - `currencyCode` is the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code, such
 *    as `USD` for the US dollar and `EUR` for the euro.
 * - `display` indicates whether to show the currency symbol or the code.
 *   - `code`: use code (e.g. `USD`).
 *   - `symbol`(default): use symbol (e.g. `$`).
 *   - `symbol-narrow`: some countries have two symbols for their currency, one regular and one
 *   narrow (e.g. the canadian dollar CAD has the symbol `CA$` and the symbol-narrow `$`).
 *   - boolean (deprecated from v5): `true` for symbol and false for `code`
 *   If there is no narrow symbol for the chosen currency, the regular symbol will be used.
 * - `digitInfo` See {\@link DecimalPipe} for detailed description.
 *  - `locale` is a `string` defining the locale to use (uses the current {\@link LOCALE_ID} by

 * - `start`: The starting index of the subset to return.
 *   - **a positive integer**: return the item at `start` index and all items after
 *     in the list or string expression.

 *   - **if negative and greater than the size of the expression**: return entire list or string.
 * - `end`: The ending index of the subset to return.
 *   - **omitted**: return all items until the end.
 *   - **if positive**: return all items before `end` index of the list or string.
 *   - **if negative**: return all items before `end` index from the end of the list or string.
 *
 * All behavior is based on the expected behavior of the JavaScript API `Array.prototype.slice()`

/**
 * A pattern that recognizes a commonly useful subset of URLs that are safe.
 *
 * This regular expression matches a subset of URLs that will not cause script
 * execution if used in URL context within a HTML document. Specifically, this
 * regular expression matches if (comment from here on and regex copied from
 * Soy's EscapingConventions):
 * (1) Either a protocol in a whitelist (http, https, mailto or ftp).
 * (2) or no protocol.  A protocol must be followed by a colon. The below
 *     allows that by allowing colons only after one of the characters [/?#].
 *     A colon after a hash (#) must be in the fragment.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a (?) must be in a query.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a single solidus (/) must be in a path.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a double solidus (//) must be in the authority
 *     (before port).
 *
 * The pattern disallows &, used in HTML entity declarations before
 * one of the characters in [/?#]. This disallows HTML entities used in the
 * protocol name, which should never happen, e.g. "h&#116;tp" for "http".
 * It also disallows HTML entities in the first path part of a relative path,
 * e.g. "foo&lt;bar/baz".  Our existing escaping functions should not produce
 * that. More importantly, it disallows masking of a colon,
 * e.g. "javascript&#58;...".
 *
 * This regular expression was taken from the Closure sanitization library.

/**
 * DomSanitizer helps preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by sanitizing
 * values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts.
 *
 * For example, when binding a URL in an `<a [href]="someValue">` hyperlink, `someValue` will be
 * sanitized so that an attacker cannot inject e.g. a `javascript:` URL that would execute code on
 * the website.
 *
 * In specific situations, it might be necessary to disable sanitization, for example if the
 * application genuinely needs to produce a `javascript:` style link with a dynamic value in it.
 * Users can bypass security by constructing a value with one of the `bypassSecurityTrust...`
 * methods, and then binding to that value from the template.
 *
 * These situations should be very rare, and extraordinary care must be taken to avoid creating a
 * Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bug!
 *
 * When using `bypassSecurityTrust...`, make sure to call the method as early as possible and as
 * close as possible to the source of the value, to make it easy to verify no security bug is
 * created by its use.
 *
 * It is not required (and not recommended) to bypass security if the value is safe, e.g. a URL that
 * does not start with a suspicious protocol, or an HTML snippet that does not contain dangerous
 * code. The sanitizer leaves safe values intact.
 *
 * \@security Calling any of the `bypassSecurityTrust...` APIs disables Angular's built-in
 * sanitization for the value passed in. Carefully check and audit all values and code paths going
 * into this call. Make sure any user data is appropriately escaped for this security context.
 * For more detail, see the [Security Guide](http://g.co/ng/security).
